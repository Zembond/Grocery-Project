                        <h5>Senior Transportation Manager</h5>
                        <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 18px;">One of the things I appreciate about working at FreshDirect is how the company consistently keeps evolving. I'm empowered to bring my ideas and be a part of the growth of the business. I started in 2009 as a route driver. Since then, I have been promoted to field manager, operations manager, assistant site manager and site manager. I became a senior transportation manager in August 2019. I love being a part of a hard-working, talented team with a strong entrepreneurial spirit.</p>

                        <h5>Depot Lead</h5>
                        <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 18px;">I came to FreshDirect nine years ago with several years of truck driving experience. I started as a route driver and was promoted to a depot lead after one year. I have moved to three different depots in the New York City area and have mentored new employees. A large part of my job is helping our runners manage their routes and ensuring our customers receive their orders on time. I really enjoy the people I work with and the opportunity to earn a good living to help support my family.</p>

                        <h5>Meat Master Butcher</h5>
                        <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 18px;">Working hard at FreshDirect has opened lots of new opportunities for me. I started seven years ago in the sortation department and from there was transferred to other departments, including meat. I was accepted into the meat apprenticeship program and upon graduating was promoted to meat butcher. You can be very successful at FreshDirect if you are willing to work hard and are open to learning new skills.</p>
